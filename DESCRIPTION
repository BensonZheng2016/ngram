Title: Fast n-Gram Tokenization
Version: 2.0
Description: An n-gram is a sequence of n "words" taken from a
    body of text in order.  This package offers utilities for creating,
    displaying, summarizing, and "babbling" n-grams.  The
    tokenization and "babbling" are handled by very efficient C
    code, which can even be build as its own standalone library.
    The babbler is a simple Markov chain.  The package also offers
    a vignette with complete example workflows and information about
    the utilities offered in the package.
